# FIT3097_A2

## Assignment Specifications
This set of particle effects were designed in Unreal Engine 5. The assignment specifics were to design a set of coherent particle effects within the same game world. I decided to go with a space theme for my particle effects.

No extraneous assets were used. Any textures used in the particle effects were created by me. The portal effect used an HDRI render of my first assignment in this unit. (refer to https://github.com/hyynes/monash-fit3097-scene).
